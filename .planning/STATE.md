## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Streamlit for UI: Simple, Python-native, team isn't developers (Pending)
- Anthropic Claude for narratives: Team preference, quality narratives (Pending)
- On-demand Airtable push (not sync): Simpler integration, team controls what goes to pipeline (Pending)
- Data-only narrative prompts: Accuracy over completeness, no hallucination (Pending)

**From 01-01 execution:**
- Python 3.14 dependency handling: Documented --only-binary flag and pyarrow workaround (Technical)
